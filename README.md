# CBIR-System

Written in JAVA, this project has been created in order to create your own content based image retrieval
The repository contains 2 files :
- algorithms.java : lots of image processing algorithms, like LBP, canny-deriche but also machine learning algorithms like Kmeans
- test.java : it is the file where I test all of my algorithms, it is the main of the program

All of the functions works but the kmeans function has to be improved
Enjoy and don't hesitate to use my sources code for you project =)
